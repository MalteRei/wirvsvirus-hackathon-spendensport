# How to contribute

We are happy about contributions to our project, because we need volunteer developers to help bring this idea to life.


Here are some important resources:

  * ["What Corona, donations and sport have in common"](https://emzudemo.de/txt/was-corona-spenden-und-sport-miteinander-zu-tun-haben-koennten) tells your how this got started,
  * [explination video](https://youtu.be/y0UAtoeRgl8) shows in under 2 minutes what GoBonsai is all about, and
  * at [devpost project](https://devpost.com/software/spendenchallenge) you will find detailed information on where we are going.


## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to wirvsvirus-hackathon-spendensport](https://github.com/MalteRei/wirvsvirus-hackathon-spendensport/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * When writing TypeScript please check your code based on [tslint](https://github.com/MalteRei/wirvsvirus-hackathon-spendensport/blob/master/frontend/spendensport/tslint.json)
  * For the Angular frontend project please have a look at [Angular coding style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)

Thanks and happy coding,
GoBonsai (now including you)
